# Point-of-Sale (POS) database.

### Background
Years ago, I worked at a company that developed Point-of-Sale (POS) systems for businesses*. As part of my role, I was responsible for SQL development and database management.

This file contains a mix of real-world queries I used in production (modified for privacy) along with some extra analytical functions I experimented with for learning and fun.

### Key Features

✅ Basic Aggregations – AVG(), MIN(), MAX(), SUM()
✅ Window Functions – OVER(), PARTITION BY, frame clauses (ROWS BETWEEN)
✅ Subqueries – Filtering with nested queries
✅ Joins – Combining Sales_Master and Sales_Detail
✅ Set Operations – INTERSECT for common records
✅ Conditional Filtering – Comparisons like price < tax
✅ Analytical Queries – Finding top sales, price trends, and customer patterns
